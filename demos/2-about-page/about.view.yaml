      We believe every company deserves to get maximum value from AI.
      Today, organizations spend billions on AI tools with zero visibility
      into what works, what's wasted, and who's actually using them.
      Flusk changes that — turning AI chaos into AI adoption, and
      scattered spend into 30x output.
